Tests:

You're probably just best off reading the tests to get an idea of how to use this library. You can open test/index.html in any browser to run the unit tests.


Examples:

For the examples to work properly they must be served from same domain as the bosh resource they are trying to connect to in order to avoid cross domain issues.
